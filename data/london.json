It's aim is to galvanise a growing community of people in a shared and sustainable commitment to creativity and social justice.\n\nSocial justice occurs where everyone has the capability to achieve their potential. A social justice network is a group of people that support each other to fulfil our creative potential as individuals, groups and communities.\n\nI’m looking for people to help explore the idea that we can build social justice simply by supporting each other. I’m particularly keen to help people create their own peer support networks and to help people help each other.\n\nThere’s no minimum commitment involved, simply a willingness to engage with your own creative potential and to explore ways we can build our capability by supporting others to build theirs.\n\nBuilding social justice is a universal process that makes no distinction between, for example service users and service providers. It is not something some of us do to others but something we build together. It is fundamentally a creative process but we are not all artists, everyone has a part to play and each of us has a unique contribution to make.\n\nI’d like to see a wide variety of self-organised networks for people working across industries, whether receiving or delivering services, whether working locally, nationally or internationally - the more people that engage the easier it will be to help people help each other.\n\nTo help facilitate this I will be making myself available both on line and in person, facilitating regular network events, sharing our news and using anything people contribute to help people work together.\n\nStarting this May I will be working with art + power (as part of the Arts Council England, lottery funded 'Creative Development Programme), to set over 300 creative challenges that will help us take small, incremental steps toward our long term goals. Each creative challenge will provide the focus for a network event including a monthly peer support forum for partners and policy makers.\n\nEach forum will provide an opportunity for people to build social justice and develop individual and collaborative projects. We will explore a creative challenge based on a key question related to social justice . There will also be plenty of opportunities for networking and peer support so that people can get feedback and support for their projects and find people to work with.\n\nThe forums and people’s responses to them will also be shared on line so that people can use them to inspire their own work, wherever they live. I’m particularly looking for stories, case studies and tools - anything that works for you and may work for others.\n\nHere are some of the questions we’ll be exploring:\nHow can we develop strategic approaches to creative development?\nHow can we develop creative solutions to social problems?\nHow can we build more capable communities?\nWhat is a development organisation?\nWhat are the conditions for creative development?\nHow can we build more creative, inclusive and sustainable communities?\nHow can we make the most of the experience in our communities?\nHow can public spaces build social justice?\nHow can we enable others to learn from our experience?\n\nIt will be totally up to you what you choose to do and who you work with but I do hope you will choose to join in and share what you learn to help inspire and support more people to build social justice together.","source":"ushahidi","publishedAt":"2014-03-27T19:19:00.000Z","updatedAt":"2014-05-28T22:07:48.781823","geo":{"coords":[-2.58791,51.454513],"addressComponents":{"adminArea1":"United Kingdom","streetAddress":"Street","adminArea3":"England","adminArea4":"Bristol","adminArea5":"Bristol","postalCode":"BS2 0","formattedAddress":"Street, Bristol, BS2 0"}},"id":"5NCstxb4S_a_vNj4wbOCDA","createdAt":"2014-05-04T06:08:46.411796"},{"remoteID":"49477-117","license":"unknown","language":{"nativeName":"English","code":"en","name":"English"},"tags":[{"confidence":1,"name":"Education"},{"confidence":1,"name":"Volunteerism"},{"confidence":1,"name":"Partnerships"}],"lifespan":"temporary","summary":"Development in Action","content":"Development in Action exists to promote global citizenship by encouraging engagement in development issues amongst young people in the UK.

Our powerful model building and simulation technology takes in to consideration the local geography and supply chain and existing condidtions as inputs in to the simulations. We make it very easy to build your model and set scenarios for your city on this website. We take into account the individual geo location information and conduct the simulation.

We have built a rock solid platform to manage and visualize the flow of materials, be it people or products using the infrastrucutre and transportation systems in your city or municipality.\n\nWe provide a spatial application on the website for you to specify the locations of critical infrastructure or nodes in your city on a map and monitor flows. Use our tools to construct what-if scenarios, such as: What if we build a landfill at this location? Use the mapping tools to create multiple models, run simulations for a number of parameters, and analyze the results.

The system orchestrates the traffic through a distributed routing algorithm in an optimal way. Ordinary navigation systems divert traffic jams onto smaller streets after they occurred, whereas nunav actively prevents traffic jams. This is possible because nunav reserves timeslots for cars on the streets. With this technique, nunav knows the position of participating cars for any given point in time, including the future.\n\nThe heart of the system is an optimized graph traversal algorithm that calculates shortest paths in a matter of milliseconds. The implementation includes many heuristics in order to reduce the complexity of calculating a route to nearly linear time.\n\nThe nunav traffic simulation software simulates various traffic flow scenarios in different congested areas. The result of the simulations: Using nunav, traffic flow is twice as fast.","source":"ushahidi","publishedAt":"2013-05-15T13:16:00.000Z","updatedAt":"2014-05-28T22:13:11.551122","geo":{"coords":[-0.119824,51.511214],"addressComponents":{"adminArea1":"United Kingdom","streetAddress":"Savoy Street & Strand","adminArea3":"England","adminArea4":"London","adminArea5":"WC2","postalCode":"WC2R 0","formattedAddress":"Savoy Street & Strand, WC2, WC2R 0"}},"id":"39zOxFWjTECN9xxfQb1gCQ","createdAt":"2014-05-04T04:49:18.162267"},{"remoteID":"27563-175","license":"unknown","language":{"nativeName":"English","code":"en","name":"English"},"tags":[{"confidence":1,"name":"Lawful Rebellion"},{"confidence":1,"name":"White Rabbit / Community Trust Contact"},{"confidence":1,"name":"Occupy Camps!"},{"confidence":1,"name":"Trials"}],"lifespan":"temporary","summary":"bonjour! help me free myself lol","content":"need advise on affidavit process who do i send it to and in wot order?","source":"ushahidi","publishedAt":"2013-05-08T13:49:00.000Z","updatedAt":"2014-05-28T22:15:02.422783","geo":{"coords":[-0.187227,51.10914],"addressComponents":{"adminArea1":"United Kingdom","streetAddress":"Beeches Crescent","adminArea3":"England","adminArea4":"West Sussex","adminArea5":"Crawley","postalCode":"RH10 6","formattedAddress":"Beeches Crescent, Crawley, RH10 6"}},"id":"4NWvtGKNQKKpsPMSCgBHkw","createdAt":"2014-05-04T05:07:27.987374"},{"remoteID":"27563-174","license":"unknown","language":{"nativeName":"English","code":"en","name":"English"},"tags":[{"confidence":1,"name":"Lawful Rebellion"}],"lifespan":"temporary","summary":"Had enough yet?","content":"Hi there,\n\nI'm in the Staffordshire area and desperately seeking people of like mind","source":"ushahidi","publishedAt":"2013-05-06T01:46:00.000Z","updatedAt":"2014-05-28T22:15:02.502744","geo":{"coords":[-2.000383,52.711558],"addressComponents":{"adminArea1":"United Kingdom","streetAddress":"42 Station Road","adminArea3":"England","adminArea4":"Staffs","adminArea5":"Cannock","postalCode":"WS12 4","formattedAddress":"42 Station Road, Cannock, WS12 4"}},"id":"EkSHj3ChQcKeKbzyr1ROxQ","createdAt":"2014-05-04T05:07:21.178475"},{"remoteID":"27563-173","license":"unknown","language":{"nativeName":"English","code":"en","name":"English"},"tags":[{"confidence":1,"name":"Lawful Rebellion"},{"confidence":1,"name":"White Rabbit / Community Trust Contact"},{"confidence":1,"name":"Occupy Camps!"},{"confidence":1,"name":"Trials"}],"lifespan":"temporary","summary":"Hi all you rebel brothers and sisters","content":"Living on the river, trying to 'educate' here.
